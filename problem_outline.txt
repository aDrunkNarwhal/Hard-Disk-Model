What is the problem?
	~ Description of Model
		- There is a box (or toroid) of unit size
		- There are N disks (all the same radius) in the box
		- These disks cannot overlap each other
		- the variable rho is the density of disks in the box
		  (i.e. total area of disks divided by area of the box)
		
	~ Goal of the Model
		- Mix the disks up so that they are randomly distributed
	
	~ What we want to find out
		- Where is the crictical density (rho) where if it is
		  too high we cannot say it mixes fast and if it lower
		  it does mix fast
	
Why is the problem important?

What is the old approach?
	- Pick a random disk and pick a random location in the box
	- If the disk can be placed there (i.e. does not overlap with
	  another disk) then move the disk there, otherwise leave it
	  where it was.

What is the new approach?
	- Pick a random disk and a random direction
	- move the disk in the chosen direction for a distance epsilon
	- If the disk collides with another disk, stop moving that disk
	  and move the collided disk in the same direction for the rest
	  of the distance.  Repeat process if this new disk collides

What is the intuition that this new approach is better?
	- This sliding approach is what is used in practice.
	- It is said to appear to mix faster than other approaches, but
	  there is no theoretical guarentee. (Just by empircal observation).

Another variation of this model.
	- There is another variation of this model where the number of
	  disks is not fixed.  Disks are allowed to leave or enter the
	  box.
	- A parameter lambda is used for the probability a disk will
	  added or removed from the box.
	- Something to learn from this model is how rho and lambda are
	  correllated.
